Cryptology
====================
Why is cryptography the necessary condition of almost all cybersecurity
* Messages in a network are literally flying through the air as radio waves and can be grabbed by any device
  * Called man in the middle attacks
  * Necessary condition of almost all cybersecurity

Primary Goals:
* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Authenticity

## Primary problems in Cryptology
Encryption  
Hashing  
Algorithms  
* Ensuring confidentiality
* Ensuring integrity
* Ensuring authenticity
  * What happens when it breaks ?

## What is Encryption ?
cryptography: "secret-writing"  
Plaintext into ciphertext

## What do we encrypt
* Network traffic
* Hard drives
* Databases

## Stealing a Key
* Brute Force Attack
  * Start with 000000000000000000000000000000
  * Incriment by one until the key is found
    * Incredibly slow
  * Bad Pseudo-random number generators (PRNG)
* Stealing a Key
  * Unencrypted connections
  * Memory scraping
  * Bribery
  * Political power

## Key size
| Key Size (bits) | Cipher     | Number of Alt. Keys | Time 10^9 decryptions/s | Time 10^13 decryptions/s |
|-----------------|------------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 56              | DES        | 2^56 ~ 7.2e16       | 2^55 ns = 1.125 yrs     | 1 hr                     |
| 128             | AES        | 2^128 ~ 3.4e38      | 2^127 ns = 5.3e21 yrs   | 5.3e17 yrs               |
| 168             | Triple DES | 2^168 ~ 3.7e50      | 2^167 ns = 5.8e33 yrs   | 5.8e29 yrs               |
| 192             | AES        | 2^196 ~ 6.3e67      | 2^191 ns = 9.8e40 yrs   | 9.8e36 yrs               |
| 256             | AES        | 2^256 ~ 1.2e77      | 2^255 ns = 1.8e60 yrs   | 1.8e56 yrs               |

## Encryption V. Usability
* Encryption is meant to be slow
* Computational feasibility

## Why you can't protect the key
* Emergency re-keying
* Period re-keying

## Asymmetric Encryption
Also known as **Public-Key Encryption**
* Can guarantee authenticity
* Very slow
* Key = 2^124

## Symmetric Encryption
* Issues: Key has to be distributed
  * High potential for risk
