Access Control
================
The walls and gates of cybersecurity
* Ancient problem
  * Let some people in, keep everyone else out
* New problem with computer systems: We don't know who 'people' are
  * Can't look at someone's face or listen to their voice, just have to go off of 0's and 1's associated with them


## Two halves of access control
**Authentication**: You are who you say you are  
**Authorization**: You're allowed to do what you're trying to do
* Set up boundaries in system
* Based mostly on organizational processes

### Confusing terms
Authorization is not access control
* Access control is an umbrella term for all protective processes
HTTP status codes
* Unauthorized = Unauthenticated
* Forbidden = Unauthorized

## Two halves of Authentication
Identification
* User claims an identity
Verification
* User must then prove they are that identity

### Three types of authentication
Something I know
* Password
  * Short hidden phrase only one person knows
Something I have
* Token
  * Most commonly will be your phone
Something I am or do
* Biometric
  * Fingerprints
  * Iris recognition (Hardest to replicate)
  * Hand print recognition
  * Handwriting recognition
  * Typing recognition

### Multifactor Authentication
Something I know and something I have
* Password w/ email verification

Something I have and something I am  
Something I know and something I am

Widely regarded as best form of authentication
* Extremely effective countermeasure for just about every attack

Questions about security v. usability


## The problems with passwords
Broken authentication
* 50% of passwords for military and govt. are weak

Follow predictable behavioral patterns

### How are passwords compromised
Guess the victim's password  
Steal the victim's password  
Reset the victim's password  
Circumvent the victim's password  

### How to guess the victims password
Through the UI
* Try every possible password
* Try common passwords
* Try default password
* Follow behavioral patterns around passwords
* Countermeasure: Lockout
* Countermeasure: Intrusion detection

Through the password file
* Little metaphorical: most likely a database, and will most likely be hashed
* Attacking the password file
  * Brute force attack
    * Hash common passwords and compare the hashes
  * Dictionary attack
    * Countermeasure: salting the hashes
  * Rainbow table attacks
