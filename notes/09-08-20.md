Security Design Principles
==============================

### Key terms to know
<b><u>Modularity</u></b>: Breaking code into small, reusable, and testable piece of code that has only one responsibility

<b><u>Inversion of Control</u></b>:

## Design Principles
### Simplicity
"Economy of Mechanism"
* Keep the design as small and as simple as possible
* Closely associated to the principle of modularity

### Fail-safe Defaults
Base access decisions on permission rather than exclusion
* By default, disallow, don't allow
* Every access to every object must be checked for authority
* Example: else blocks, catch blocks

### Open Design
'The design should not be secret'
* Opposite: Security through Obscurity
* Secret key vs Secret design

<b><u>Kerckoffs's Priciple:</u></b> "A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything is known about the system, except the key, is public knowledge"

### Multi-factor Authentication
'Separation of privilege'
* Don't just require a password: A lock that has two keys is better than one
* Examples:
  1. Verification codes
  1. Emails
  1. Fingerprint\\ Bio scanners
* Two-factor authentication
  * Authenticate something you know
  * Authenticate something you have
  * Authenticate something you are

### Least Privilege
"Every program and user of the system should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to complete the job"
* Not only just per user, but also per action

### Isolation
'Least common Mechanism'
* Minimize the amount of mechanism common to more than one user, and depended on by all users ... <u>especially ones involving shared variables</u>

Examples
  1. Global variables
  1. Virtual Machines
  1. Side-Channel attacks
  1. Unsecured networks

* Isolate:
  * Public Data and networks from private data and networks
  * Users/programs/processes from others in the system
  * Key security mechanisms from other mechanisms in the system
  * Encapsulation (OOP)

### Usability
'Psychological acceptability'
```
"It is essential that the human interface be designed for
 ease of use, so that users routinely and automatically
 apply the protection mechanisms correctly"
```
* Principle of least surprise

## Some additional security design principles
Computational Feasibility
* 'Work factor'
* Not impossible, but unprofitable

Intrusion Detection
* 'Compromise Recording'
* Redundancy: Multiple layers of security

Simplicity
Fail-safe Defaults
Complete Mediation
Open Design
Multi-Factor Design
