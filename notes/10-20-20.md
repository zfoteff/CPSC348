Web Based Attacks
=========================

These attacks are specific only to web applications

## Cross Site Scripting
Injects JavaScript to a web page and has the web page run the code
* OWASP #7

## Background web knowledge
Web is built up of mainly three languages
1. HTML: Structure of page
1. CSS: Appearance of page
1. JavaScript: Actions of the page
  * Can also consider SQL to be another essential language

## XSS Goals
* Steal authentication token
* Send authenticated requests
* Log keystrokes
* Manipulate content on page
  * Add invisible elements
  * Change destinations of links
* Prompt unwanted downloads and uploads
* Load scripts
* Type and click for the user
* Collect data from the page (bank, page, email)

## XSS Attack execution
Look for a place where input is rendered on the page
* Shows that a new element is being created for the page

Try uploading a script to the input that changes a part of the page
* Check is console.log() outputs, or if alert("text")
* wrap the content with \<script>***JavaScript***\</script> tags
* document.cookie will give the attacker the cookie for the document

Often pages know to check for script tags in user input, so if you put the script in an on error method for an element, then the script may run correctly
