## Problems with encryption for integrity
Accepted wisdom: Encryption is *insufficient* for integrity
* Meaningful v. Meaningless
* Block reordering
* Tampering v. Errors
* Pure chance -- guessed key decrypts message
* Corrupted targeted blocks
Lots of

## Hashing
Irreversibly mapping arbitrary-length data to a unique fixed length code
1. Takes arbitrary length input (bits)
1. Outputs fixed length code
1. Is fast
1. Is irreversible
1. Avoids collisions
Most common hash algorithm: SHA-256 ("Secure Hash Algorithm - 256 bits")
Means there are an infinite amount of inputs, but a finite amount of outputs, therefore there will always be collisions

## Hashing uses
* Hash Tables
  * Data structure, dictionary that maps hash code to hash value
* Passwords
  * Passwords are hashed by services and cannot be seen in plain text to ensure confidentiality
* Message Integrity
  * If someone can come up with a string of characters that collide with your password the person can have access to your account
* File Integrity

## Hash Collisions
Average: 2^(n/2) guesses to find a collision
