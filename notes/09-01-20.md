Computer Security 348: Professor Corwin Bryan
=====================

# Why take a computer security class?
1. Because cyber attacks do real harm to real people
1. The industry needs to change

## Real possibilites of harm (Vague)
* Disrupting society by targeting water facilities
* Assassination by insulin pump
* Hacking a nuclear power plant
* Shutting down hospital with malware
* Committing grand theft auto with ransom ware in self-driving cars

It is becoming more and more likely for cyberwarfare to illicit military response

## Real possiblities of harm (realistic)
* Someone working paycheck to paycheck has a check bounce because hackers stole money from them
* Elderly person falls for multiple phishing attacks

## Industry needs to change
* Breaches big and small continue to happen
* Some breaches go undetected for months or years
* New vulnerabilities are found all the time
* Process of digital transformation to the cloud continues without much thought to security
* US Companies are not always required to report data breaches

### Write code with security in mind and encourage coworkers to do the same
