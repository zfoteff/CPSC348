Security Configuration
================

Most common cybersecurity vulnerability  
How to secure *existing* systems
* How do you get security in a world that expects usability

## Terms
**Hardening**: A documented highly organized process of changing systems to be more secure

**Attack Surface**: The total area that an attacker could find and exploit Vulnerabilities
* Things increase and decrease an attack surface
  * Too many apps increases the surface, deleting default apps shrinks the surface

**Attack Vector**: One specific path an attacker could take to exploit a system  

**Cyber Hygiene**: Apparently is too stupid to learn about   

## What do we configure
* Databases
* Networks
* Operating systems
* Servers

## Server Configuration
### What is a server ?
A computer that runs an app
* Web
* Database
* Mail
* Minecraft

### Vulnerabilities and Countermeasures
* OS Command Injection
  * Countermeasure: Limit permissions of app running on the server
* Path Traversal
  * Restrict the app to only certain files or directories on the server
* XSS
  * Content Security Policy: Specifies where scripts can originate from
  * HttpOnly attribute of HTTP cookies: Restricts JavaScript content
  * SameSite attribute of cookie: Keeps other sites from accessing data from a
    site
  * Secure attribute of cookie: Forces data to be transmitted using HTTPS protocol secure connections.
    * Doesn't prohibit insecure connections
* CSRF
  * CSRF Tokens
  * SameSite attribute of HTTP cookies
* Session Hijacking
  * Secure attribute of HTTP cookies
* Credential Stuffing
  * Rate-Limiting: Reduce the rate that the attacker can attack an application
* Denial of Service (DoS)
  * Rate-Limiting
* Protocol downgrade attack
  * Allow only encrypted connections
* All vulnerabilities
  * Proper error handling
  * Firewalls
  * Remove unnecessary apps, services, features, user accounts, etc-

### Enforcing Encryption
* Application: Redirect HTTP --> HTTPS
* Firewall: Close port 80, open 443
* HTTP header: Strict-Transport-Security

## Security Configuration - General Themes
### Design Principles
* Defense-in-depth (layering)
  * There exist multiple mitigations for
    1. Credential Stuffing
    1. Injection
    1. Enforcing Encryption
  * Will never completely prevent these attacks because of unknown vulnerabilities in apps or in a computer system
  * Having these multiple mitigations gives an admin lots of options for responding to attacks of any kind
* Monitoring
  * Continuous monitoring is crucial
* Automation
  * Security Configuration cannot be done manually
  * Automated attacks are common against large networked computer systems
  * Automated detection can help mitigate automated attacks
    * Vulnerability scanners help with this
  * Automated configuration helps secure computer systems
    1. Creating system images
    1. Enforcing group policy
  * Everything else should fall into an organizational process

## Patch Management
* New vulnerabilities are addressed through patches or upgrades
