Securing computer systems
======================

# Applications
## What is an applications
A software program on a hardware device
* Types
  1. Desktop
  1. Mobile
  1. Web

# Injection
## What is an injection attack
An injection attack is an attack where the victims app runs the attacker code
* Whats being injected is the code
* Is generally what people think of when they think of hacking

## Why is injection so bad
* OWASP #1 = Injection
* Very easy to detect
* Very easy to exploit
* Still quite common
* Very powerful
  * Easy to grab password file

## Why is injection so bad
Two conditions:
* The app accepts user input
* The app makes calls to external systems

Specifically the app trusts the user input

# The Golden Rule of App Security
Under the full range of possible inputs, the application should either
* Continue to work
* Fail gracefully

## What is input sanitation
Make harmful inputs harmless
* SanitizedInput sanitize(Input input);
* Methods
  * Escaping/ Encoding
  * Parameterization

## What is input validation
Determine whether input is harmful
* bool isValid(Input input);
* Methods
  * Simple boolean checks
  * Regex
  * Validators

## Validate or Sanitize
* Report errors to user
  * Validate
* Checking size
  * Validate
* "Correcting" user input would cause confusion
  * Validate
* Otherwise
  * Sanitize
