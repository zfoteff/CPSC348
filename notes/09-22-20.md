Hashing V. Encryption
============================

## Today
* Transport Layer Security (TLS)
* Algorithms
  * AES
  * SHA-2
  * RSA

## Combining Hashing and Encryption
* Message Authentication Codes (MAC)
* Digital signatures
* Public-Key certificates
* Transport Layer Security (TLS)

## Symmetric Encryptions
* Substitutions (swapping one bit for another)
  * Function that performs substitutions: S-box
* Permutation (moving bits, eg. left/ right shift)
  * Function that performs permutations: P-box

### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
* Key size: 128, 192, 256
* Block size: 128 bits
* Rounds: 10-14 (depending on  key size)
  * A *Round* is defined by a 4 step process
    1. Substitute bytes
    1. Shift rows
    1. Mix columns
    1. Add round key
      * Round key is derived from key and gets xor'd into block
      * Introduces and element of randomness

### Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)
* SHA-1
* SHA-2
* SHA-3
* Proceedure
  * Break meassage into blocks
  * Initialize the output buffer
    * sqrt(2) = 1.41421 ... -> 41421
  * Run 80 rounds (subs, perms) using the first 7 primes
* In general: It requires 2^(n/2) guesses on average between two hash codes of length n
  * 256 bit output --> 2^(256/2) guesses
* Weaknesses
  * Depends on unpredictability of primes
  * Susceptible to cryptanalysis
    * Discovered but not public
  * 2005 - SHA-1 shattered

### Symetric V. Asymetric
* Symmetric: Subs and perms
* Asymmetric: Mathematical operations on large primes

## RSA
### RSA Key Generation
1. Select 2 primes, p and q, where p != q
1. Calculate n = p*q
1. Calculate the Euler totient of n, F(n) = (p-1)*(q-1)
1. Select *e* less than F(n) and relatively prime to F(n)
  * Relatively prime refers to prime factors in prime
1. Select *d* less than F(n) such that d*e % F(n) = 1

**Public Key**: {e, n}  
**Private Key**: {d, n}

### RSA Encryption
* To encrypt: P^e mod n = C
* To decrypt: C^d mod n = p

### Cracking RSA
* We know d*e % F(n) = 1
* We know F(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)
* We know n = p*q
* We have e and n
**Factor n into p and q**
* Many different ways of factoring integers
* New methods can be faster than older ones

## Final thoughts
* We use primes because we don't understand them
* Cryptography is an arms race
  * Processing power
  * Cryptographic research
* Government agencies may be making secret discoveries
* Pick strong algorithms and balance usability
