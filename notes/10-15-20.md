Buffer Overflow
=================

## Buffer Overflow
One of the oldest vulnerabilities  
Overread vs overwrite
  * Overread: When the attacker reads past the end of buffer into memory
  * Overwrite: When the attacker writes past the end of buffer into memory

Consequences
  * Overread: Heartbleed - massive loss of confidentiality
  * Overwrite: Stack smashing - can be used to execute private Methods

Buffer overflow is prevented by checking the size of the input  
Languages like C and C++ are very vulnerable, however the speed of programs outputted by these languages can offset the detriments
* Most other modern languages are not vulnerable to buffer overflow

## Buffer Overread
When attacker reads over the end of the buffer
* Loss of confidentiality
* Stack Smashing
  * Changes what programs are run

## Buffer Overwrite
When the attacker writes over the end of the buffer

## Integer Overflow exploitation
Takes advantage of signed v. unsigned numbers  
When a number reaches its upper limit the number will wrap around, so for example making a query for entry 20 billion will only get you entry 20
