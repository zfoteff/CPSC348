Key Terms and Concepts
======================
Optional Reading Assignment: Chapter one of textbook

## Key Terms
### Definition of Computer Security:
The discipline of identifying vulnerabilities in computer systems and designing and implementing controls

### NIST
NIST five functions to protect computer systems
 1. Identify
 1. Protect
 1. Detect
 1. Respond
 1. Recover

### Risk modeling
* Assets
  * People, Products, Processes
* Threat
  * Can be human threats, automated threats, or natural threats
* Control/Countermeasures
  * What we're learning through the course
  * Can be protective, preventative, detective,responsive, or recovery controls
* Vulnerability
* Security Incident
  *
  * Not necessarily malicious, can be accidental

## Key Ideas
### Security is never perfect
Humans are never perfect -> Security is never perfect
* Incidents are always possible
* Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
  * These are generally nation-states with semi-unlimited resources and time that are always looking for ways to exploit valuable computer systems
* NIST: Not just protect in their job description

### Security is never one and done
* Team learns new techniques or technology
* New vulnerabilities are discovered
* New features are added
* Faster processors are invented
  * Encryption algorithms get (relatively) weaker
* Security budget changes
  * Increase: Find unaddressable vulnerabilities
  * Decrease: Cut costs, protect most critical assets
* New needs arise
* Must be maintained over time
  * Much more difficult than securing a system once

### Security vs. Usability
Usability: The application solves the users problem quickly, easily, and delightfully
* Strong passwords aren't memorable, memorable passwords aren't strong
* Most businesses care more about competing goals, some about security
  * Cost
  * Speed of development
  * Privacy

### Thinking like an attacker
We commonly think like users of a system, as opposed to thinking like an attacker
* Great developers must learn both mindsets

### CIA Triad
"Threat consequences" or "Loss effects"
* Confidentiality: Data may only be viewed by authorized users
* Integrity: Data may be added, deleted, or modified only by authorized users and in legitimate ways
* Availability: Data must be available at all applicable times to all authorized users
* Minor problem: Overlap/ Ambiguity
* Major problem: Assumes computer systems are only information systems
  * Data vs. System integrity
  * What about stealing/harming users with malicious processes

## What makes security difficult: Summary
* Highly capable threats
* Changes over time
* Competing goals
* Thinking like an attacker
* Complex and boring
