More Authentication & Access Control
==========================

## Bad password habits
* Reusing passwords
* Using common passwords
* using formulaic passwords

## Good password practices
* Password complexity requirements
* Password history
* Password expiration

## Password Manager Downsides
* Setup
  * Make an account and set master password
  * Install password manager on all devices
  * Generate and save secure password
* All devices
* Can't always access it
* Cloud storage or not
* The master password
* Account recovery
* All eggs in one basket

## Stealing the victims password
* Attacks
  1. Workplace attacks
    * Counterattack: Employee training
  1. Key loggers, memory scrapers, XXS
    * Counterattack: Anti-malware, training
  1. Man in the middle attacks
    * Counterattack: Encryption
  1. Phishing
    * Counterattack: common sense

## Session Hijacking
Session: Period of time where you are authenticated in an application
* How session ID's get stolen
  * Cross site scripting (XSS)
    * Countermeasure: Later topic
  * Unencrypted connections
    * Countermeasure: Secure flag
  * URL exposure
    * Countermeasure: Don't
  * Weak encryption
    * Countermeasure: Don't
* JSON Web tokens (JWTs):
  * 3 components: header, payload, signature
  * Payload: structure and custom claims
  * Same structure as TLS record protocol
* Invalidate session ID's
  * Inactivity timeout
  * Close browser
  * Admin deletes/locks user
  * Payload data changes
  * User logs in

# Authentication
Authentication: You're allowed to do what you're trying to do  
Authorization terminology
* User
* Resource
* Action
* Permission

# Attacks on Authorization
* Lie about permissions
* Find actions with no server-side authentication

# Common Authorization Mistakes
* Trusting user input (web apps)
  * URLS
* Permissions not granular enough
* Permissions too granular
